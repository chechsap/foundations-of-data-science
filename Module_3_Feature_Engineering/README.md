# Module 3: Feature Engineering
This module builds on top of [Module 2: Data_Wrangling](../Module_2_Data_Wrangling) and covers how to create new features from existing columns or features of the current dataset. This is a useful step for exploratory analysis and for preparing the data for any form of modeling (i.e. machine learning, regression, etc.).

### Materials
Watch the accompanying videos provided in the class repository and follow along with the Jupyter notebooks provided here.

* [01_Feature_Engineering.ipynb](01_Feature_Engineering.ipynb)

Make sure to follow the instructions inside the notebook to download the data files needed. This notebook uses the [CitiBike Trip History Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) which is stored in their Amazon S3 (https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). 

For the example to work, use the [201901-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201901-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip). It's a compressed zip file. Kindly extract the contents and move the CSV file to the same folder as the notebook.

### Exercises
After completing the lessons and the sample notebooks, test your understanding and practice given the corresponding exercise prompts in the exercise notebook provided. This will test concepts explained in both **Module 2: Data Wrangling** and **Module 3: Feature Engineering**.
